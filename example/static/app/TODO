- create services at the level of each resource that share attributeds and logic for create/read/update/delete

- watch or callback when a data object changes or is set so we can coerice/cast into types the UI expects and the reciprocal for RESt service

- change class selector based on routing information

- make a route for edit that passes in the number and retrives the javascript foo object based on id

- make the create and edit forms deal with child forms for bazzes and bars

- think about writing tests
